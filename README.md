# Parkside 20V Battery Step Down Transformer

 ***Disclaimer: Please note, the Pandamime Parkside 20V Battery Step Down Transformer (from here on, known as Transformer, cause that sounds so cool!) is a tool. When wielding a powerful and awesome tool, you must take care. It is electrifying. It can cause fires if improperly used. It can also pop any device you plug into it without setting the correct voltage. While I have tested it to the best of my abilities, I have written this document to make the Transformer as user friendly and safe as possible. All I am trying to say is that this tool is entirely your responsibility and I don’t take any responsibility for any damages or injuries the Transformer may cause.***

## Description
The Transformer is a device that is adapted to the Parkside 20V battery (2ah/4ah) which allows you to connect devices that require a power source. For instance;
I had a 12V Dremel, which required a power pack that delivered 220V. I needed the Dremel in a remote place where I did not have a mains available. After reading the “output” on the power pack, I noticed it required 12V to power the Dremel. I got to rigging together some wires and a step down transformer to test whether it would work and to my surprise, it did! I then designed a seat for the step down transformer and this was the inception of the Transformer (not the kind that switch from a car to a metal person, but that would be sick!).

Other examples include:
1. Using the battery pack to power my Raspberry Pi, allowing me to use a computer remotely.
2. Powering an Arduino board with a SIM808 sim card module (I wanted to make a security tracker that used my Parkside 20V battery to power it).
3. Arduino board using a CNC shield to control my CNC machine.

## Usage
Using the Transformer couldn't be simpler. Say you want to power a 5V LED. Do not have anything plugged into the Transformer (that includes the LED, do NOT plug it in yet).
1. First, slide the Transformer onto the battery until the battery latch is engaged (holding the Transformer in place). 
2. You should see the LCD light along with an LED, indicating the Transformer is powered up. 
3. Next, using the button on the Transformer, click it until the Right LED is ON (this indicates the Transformer LCD is displaying the "Output" voltage). 
4. Adjust the voltage (clockwise increases voltage, anti-clockwise decreases voltage) using a small flat head screw driver on the Transformers potentiometer, watching the LCD values changing to the desired voltage (for our 5V LED example, we want the LCD to show 5V).
5. Once you have the desired output voltage, press the latch on the battery, and slide the Transformer off of the battery. 
6. Connect your device to the terminal on the backside of the Transformer (pay attention to the positive and negative indicators).
7. Once you have plugged in your device, go ahead and reinsert your Transformer onto the battery and watch your device come to life!
8. Have fun!
9. Don't do drugs! 
10. Stay in school!
